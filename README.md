## Arduino Measure Exact Time Lapse between Two Events
This code uses two switches. When switch-1 is pressed the time counting starts and when switch-2 is pressed time counting stops to show the exact time lapse between the two events of pressing the switches.<br>

### Important Note
Whiel using the code, you must connect two resistors across one terminal of each switch and 5V rail.<br>
So when the switch is pressed that particular pin will be momentarily grounded.
